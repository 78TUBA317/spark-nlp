## Description 
The Universal Sentence Encoder encodes text into high,dimensional vectors that can be used for text classification, semantic similarity, clustering and other natural language tasks.,The model is trained and optimized for greater,than,word length text, such as sentences, phrases or short paragraphs. It is trained on a variety of data sources and a variety of tasks with the aim of dynamically accommodating a wide variety of natural language understanding tasks. The input is variable length English text and the output is a 512 dimensional vector. We apply this model to the STS benchmark for semantic similarity, and the results can be seen in the example notebook made available. The universal,sentence,encoder model is trained with a deep averaging network (DAN) encoder.,The details are described in the paper "[Universal Sentence Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11175)".

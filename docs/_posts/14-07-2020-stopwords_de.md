## Description 
This model removes 'stop words' from text. Stop words are words so common that they can removed without significantly altering the meaning of a text. Removing stop words is useful when one wants to deal with only the most semantically important words in a text, and ignore words that are rarely semantically relevant, such as articles and prepositions.

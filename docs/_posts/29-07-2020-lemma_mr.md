## Description 
This model uses context and language knowledge to assign all forms and inflections of a word to a single root. This enables the pipeline to treat the past and present tense of a verb, for example, as the same word instead of two completely different words. The lemmatizer takes into consideration the context surrounding a word to determine which root is correct when the word form alone is ambiguous.

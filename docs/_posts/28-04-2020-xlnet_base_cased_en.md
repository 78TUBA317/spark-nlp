## Description 
XLNet is a new unsupervised language representation learning method based on a novel generalized permutation language modeling objective. Additionally, XLNet employs Transformer,XL as the backbone model, exhibiting excellent performance for language tasks involving long context. Overall, XLNet achieves state,of,the,art (SOTA) results on various downstream language tasks including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking. The details are described in the paper "[‚ÄãXLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237)"

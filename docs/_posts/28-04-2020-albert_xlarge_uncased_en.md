## Description 
ALBERT is "A Lite" version of BERT, a popular unsupervised language representation learning algorithm. ALBERT uses parameter,reduction techniques that allow for large,scale configurations, overcome previous memory limitations, and achieve better behavior with respect to model degradation. The details are described in the paper "[ALBERT: A Lite BERT for Self,supervised Learning of Language Representations.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942)"
